<p>
Based on a book, <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book">Team Topologies</a> authored by Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais. References a number of real world case
studies and is heavily informed by 'Reverse Conways Law'.
</p>

<p>
Team topologies are mainly designed for flow of change.
</p>

<p>
Focuses on a team first approach primarily aiming at reducing team cognitive load.
</p>

<p>
Discusses four team type and three interaction modes.

<h3 id="org9894c26">Responsibilities of complicated-subsystem teams</h3>
<p>
Responsible for building and maintaining a part of the system that depends on specialist knowledge.
</p>

<ul>
<li>attempts to reduce the cognitive load of stream-aligned teams working on systems that include/use the complicated subsystem</li>
<li>examples of complicated subsystems; video processing codec, a mathematical model, a face-recognition engine etc</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgdca236c">
<h3 id="orgdca236c">When to use complicated-subsystem teams</h3>
<p>
The decision about whether a complicated subsystem team is required is dependant on an assessment of the teams
cognitive load not simply that it is a shared component. I.e. the complicated subsystem has to require specialist
knowledge.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgf8ff2f6">
<h3 id="orgf8ff2f6">Expected behaviours</h3>
<ul>
<li>mindful of current stage of development of the subsystem and acts accordingly: high level of collaboration with
stream-aligned team(s) during exploration/early development, focus on subsystem interfaces and feature evolution in
later stages.</li>
<li>delivery speed and quality of subsystem should be higher than if it was embedded in a stream-aligned team</li>
<li>prioritizes and delivers upcoming work respecting and aligning to the needs of the stream-aligned team(s) that use
the subsystem</li>
<li>includes all the specialist knowledge required but follows software engineering best practices like any other team</li>

<p>
Responsible for researching, learning and introducing new practices, techniques, tooling, etc.
</p>

<p>
Composed of specialists in a given technical (or product) domain and they help stream-aligned teams to take on new
capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Strong collaborative nature; they strive to understand the problems and shortcomings of stream-aligned teams in
order to provide effective guidance. Sometimes referred to as "Technical Consulting Teams".

<li>proactively understand needs of stream-aligned teams with regular checkpoints and agreeing when more collaboration required</li>
<li>keep abreast of new approaches, tooling and practices in their area of expertise</li>
<li>messenger of good news and bad news</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org87ab04a">
<h3 id="org87ab04a">Expected behaviours</h3>

<p>
Enable stream-aligned teams to deliver work with substantial autonomy.
</p>

<p>
Provides internal services to reduce cognitive load required from stream-aligned teams.
</p>

<p>
Provide a small number of high quality services usually using an X-as-a-service interaction mode and defining a
team API.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org85953da">
<h3 id="org85953da">Expected behaviours</h3>
<ul>
<li>collaboration with stream-aligned teams to understand needs</li>
<li>fast prototyping and involve stream-aligned team members for fast feedback</li>
<li>strong focus on usability and reliability for their services (treating the platform as a product)</li>

teams &amp; consuming lower-level platforms as required</li>

<blockquote >
<p>
"Emphasise the User Experience"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suited to situations where there is a need for one or more teams to use a code library, component. API or platform
  that "just works".
  In this model, teams can rely on certain aspects of their technology landscape being provided as a service by other teams.

</section>
<section id="slide-org2e5ac81">
<h3 id="org2e5ac81">Advantages</h3>
<ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
Suited to situations where one or more teams would benefit from the active help of another team facilitating (or
coaching) some aspect of their work.
</p>

<p>
This is the main operating mode of an enabling team as the remit of facilitating mode is to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>enable other teams to be more effective,</li>
<li>learn more quickly</li>
<li>understand a technology better</li>
<li>discover/remove common problems</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0865a55">
<h3 id="org0865a55">Constraint</h3>
<p>
A team should expect to use the facilitating interaction mode with a small number of other teams simultaneously,

</section>
<section id="slide-orgafbeacc">
<h3 id="orgafbeacc">Typical Uses</h3>
<ul>
<li>an enabling team helping a stream-aligned, complicated-subsystem or platform team</li>
