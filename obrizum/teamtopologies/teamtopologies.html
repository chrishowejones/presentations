<p>
Based on a book, <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book">Team Topologies</a> authored by Matthew Skelton &amp; Manuel Pais. References a number of real world case
studies and is heavily informed by 'Reverse Conways Law'.
</p>

<p>
Team topologies are mainly designed for flow of change.
</p>

<p>
Discusses four team type and three interaction modes.

<ul>
<li>assigned to a single, valuable stream of work</li>
<li>e.g. product, service, user journey, user persona</li>
<li><b>empowered</b> to deliver customer value as quickly, safely &amp; independantly as possible</li>

<h3 id="orgccac7f0">Key characteristics of stream-aligned teams</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-disciplinary</li>
<li>Not aligned to a single project</li>
<li>Work flows to them from multiple sources</li>

<h3 id="orgf470bdf">Capabilities of stream-aligned teams</h3>
<p>
Typical capabilities may include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Application security</li>
<li>Commercial and Operational visibility analysis</li>
<li>Design and architecture</li>
<li>Development and coding (full stack)</li>
<li>Infrastructure and operability</li>
<li>Metrics and monitoring</li>
<li>Product management and ownership</li>
<li>Testing and QA</li>
<li>UX</li>
<li>Data Science and data engineering</li>

<h3 id="orgec7eaaf">Expected behaviours</h3>
<ul>
<li>steady flow of feature delivery</li>
<li>course corrects based on feedback from latest changes</li>
<li>experimental approach to product evolution, learn and adapt</li>
<li>minimal (ideally zero) hand-off of work to other teams</li>
<li>evaluated on sustainable flow of change it produces</li>
<li>has time and space to address code quality changes (pays down tech debt)</li>
<li>proactively collaborates with supporting topology teams (complicated subsystem, enabling and platform)</li>

<h3 id="org98ae97d">Responsibilities of complicated-subsystem teams</h3>
<p>
Responsible for building and maintaining a part of the system that depends on specialist knowledge.
</p>

<ul>
<li>attempts to reduce the cognitive load of stream-aligned teams working on systems that include/use the complicated subsystem</li>
<li>examples of complicated subsystems; video processing codec, a mathematical model, a face-recognition engine etc</li>

</ul>

<p>
The decision about whether a complicated subsystem team is required is dependant on an assessment of the teams
cognitive load not simply that it is a shared component. I.e. the complicated subsystem has to require specialist
knowledge.
</p>

<section id="slide-org9ae2c11">
<h3 id="org9ae2c11">Capabilities of Complicated subsystem teams</h3>
<p>
Typical capabilities may include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>mindful of current stage of development of the subsystem and acts accordingly: high level of collaboration with
stream-aligned team(s) during exploration/early development, focus on subsystem interfaces and feature evolution in
later stages.</li>
<li>delivery speed and quality of subsystem should be higher than if it was embedded in a stream-aligned team</li>
<li>prioritizes and delivers upcoming work respecting and aligning to the needs of the stream-aligned team(s) that use
the subsystem</li>
<li>includes all the specialist knowledge required but follows software engineering best practices like any other team</li>

</ul>
